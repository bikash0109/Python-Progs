According to the observation.txt, its clear that as the data size increases, efficiency of merge sort better than
Selection sort, as because its a divide and conquer algorithm, it has more advantage over sequential algorithms.

As we can see, as the size of list grows, the number of comparisons made are significantly higher in selection sort,
while in merge sort, we know for sure, that half part of the array is sorted.

while trying for 10^6 N, merge sort came up in 11.22 seconds, where as selection sort, went on for 10 minutes and still
no output.
Based on algorithm selection sort has O(n^2) time complexity - 16666666666.66667 seconds - in worst case.
Merge Sort - 1000000 - 11.224970secs
