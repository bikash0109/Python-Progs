Test 1:
Test 1 is taken from the first page of the problem solving session.
Originally, the intent of this test was to show that the known path from
(0,2) to the exit was found by the algorithm( see front of first page of
problem solving). However, as can be seen by examining the puzzle,
every point on the puzzle has a path to the exit. The intent of the test
now is to see whether the algorithm finds the shortest path from every
point to the exit.

Test 2:
Test 2 sees whether the algorithm recognizes when there is no path to the
exit from a given point. As can be seen in the text file of this test, one
area of the frozen pond is encircled by rocks. Any point within this circle
should have no path to the exit.

Test 3:
Test 3 is intended to test the algorithm on a far more complex and varied
frozen puzzle than either test 1 or test 2's puzzles. If we look at the text
file, we can see that, unlike test 2, it is not clear whether a given point
will or will not reach the end. Furthermore, test 3 is larger and contains
far more rocks than test 1, meaning that it takes longer to verify whether
a path reaches the end or not.
