Test 1:
Test 1 is taken from the problem statement of the writeup.The intent of this
test was to show that the known path from (0,2) to the exit was found by the
program. Also, there are many point which leads to exist, the intent here is
find the shorted paths.

Test 2:
Test 2 is to check if the program detects that there is no path to exit from a
given point. One area of the frozen pond is encircled by rocks. Any point in
rock area will not have a path to exit.

Test 3:
Test 3 is intended to test the program on complex graph. It is larger and contains
far more rocks than test 1, meaning that it takes longer to verify whether
a path reaches the end or not.
